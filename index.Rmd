## Brazilian Labor Data

Brazilian Work and Employment Ministry releases microdata from all hiring and separations in the country, monthly. This data is available [here](ftp://ftp.mtps.gov.br/pdet/microdados/CAGED/).

--- .class #id 

## The Data

After being cleaned and grouped for this exercise, the data looks like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
db <- readRDS('assets/data/db.rds')
head(db)
```


--- .class #id 

## What to see on the App
With the App hosted at [shinyapps.io](https://joaoapb.shinyapps.io/brazilian_labor_stats/) you can check the evolution by year and State of Hiring, Separations and the Net Hiring in Brazil, from 2009 to 2016, in a nice map. 

On the second tab, you can check the aggregated value for Brazil, as well as the year over year variation, along with a nice regression over the line.
